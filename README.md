Bresenham's Algorithms Implementation in PyGame

This project demonstrates the implementation of Bresenham's line and circle drawing algorithms using PyGame. The code draws three lines and three concentric circles on a graphical window. The calculations are performed using Bresenham's efficient integer-based algorithms, making it ideal for rendering precise lines and circles on a pixel-based screen.

Language: Python
Library: PyGame

Features:
- Draws lines and circles using Bresenham's algorithm.
- Supports real-time rendering on a PyGame window.
- Customizable colors and coordinates for shapes.
- Input: Coordinates and radius values are hardcoded for demonstration purposes.

Feel free to clone this repository and modify the coordinates, colors, or algorithms to explore more about computer graphics and algorithmic rendering!
